# Blackjack 21:
This is a game of Blackjack 21, the classic card game played at casinos and game nights.

The basic objective of this game is to get your card value closer to 21 than your player, but without surpassing it. 

You can play this game with the computer and within it, you can also learn its rules.

## Bugs:
* Along the creation of the webstie, some bugs appeared, but they were solved as they came up
* It was very difficult to get the program to count the cards correctly, especially the As. Giving the As higher values and sorting the cards allowed for the program to read them last, therefore determining if their value was 1 or 11.
* I also had issues with the rules division. Issue was solved by using the z-indexes and visibility attribute in CSS.
